# Errors in Burger-based software and how to handle them

## The console

All Burger-based software uses a simple logging system that outputs to TTY. Log files are not provided by default and users are expected to use pipes to redirect the logs as they wish.

A log entry looks something like this:

| DATE | HUMAN-READABLE TIME | LOGLEVEL | DESCRIPTION | UNIX TIME* |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1969/12/31 | 11:59:59 | [INFO] | Added a new user at | 0000000000 |

*Unix time is only supplied once the server starts. The "Welcome" log that is outputted at the beginning of the program does not contain a timestamp (E.G `1970/12/31 00:00:00 [INFO] Welcome to Burgernotes! Today we are running on IP 0.0.0.0 on port 8080.`)

## Log levels

There are 5 different log levels, with differing amounts of urgency

| INFO | WARN | ERROR | CRITICAL | FATAL | PROMPT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Usually harmless infomation, like a user being created | A warning about bad practices being used, such as having an unset config option | An error that disrupts user experience and may lead to undesired client-side behaviour | An error that affects all users on the platform | An error sevear enough to warrent crashing the server process | Anything that asks the user for input, like a confirmation dialog (typically has no timestamp) |

## Error reporting

Clients will be given 500 status code and an error code if any errors were to affect them. They are told to come to this page for more infomation. If you are one such client, please go to the issues tab and paste the error code along with some context, so we can fix the bug.
