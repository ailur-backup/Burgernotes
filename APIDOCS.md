# üçî Burgernotes API docs
Use the Burgernotes API to automate tasks, build your own client, and more!

Headers should be: "Content-type: application/json; charset=UTF-8" for all POSTs

## üîë Authentication

POST - /api/signup - provide "username" and "password".

POST - /api/login - provide "username", "password"

To prevent the server from knowing the encryption key, the password you provide in the request must be hashed with the SHA-3 algorithm with 128 iterations (the hash is hashed again 128 times).

Password should be at least 8 characters, username must be under 20 characters and alphanumeric.

If username is taken, error code 422 will return.

Assuming everything went correctly, the server will return a secret key.

You'll need to store two things in local storage:
- The secret key you just got, used to fetch notes, save stuff etc.
- A SHA512 hashed password, used as encryption key

## üîê Encryption

Note content and title is encrypted using AES 256-bit.

Encryption password is the SHA512 hashed password we talked about earlier.
