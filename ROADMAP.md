# Burgernotes Roadmap

- Switch to WebSockets for updating notes + live updating of note list and more, this involves redoing some APIs
- Compress notes to reduce bandwidth and storage
- Use OAuth for authentication
- Dedicated domain (not just a subdomain, if anyone can donate a domain let Arzumify know!)
